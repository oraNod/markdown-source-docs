# markdown-source-docs

This repository contains a few Markdown files for use in a workshop.
Files were shamelessly borrowed from [smallrye-reactive-messaging](https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-reactive-messaging) and not intended for any usage other than demonstrating how to convert a bunch of Markdown files to Asciidoc.
